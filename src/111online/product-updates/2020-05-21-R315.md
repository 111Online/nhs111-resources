## Summary of release

Interim measure for pregnancy risks factors linked to coronavirus fever.

Following engagement with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (RCOG), our clinical team have been advised there are some instances of coronavirus complications with pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, linked to fever.

As an interim measure ahead of Pathways update 19.3.8 the addition of messaging early in the journey directing those who are pregnant and have a fever to call 111 was agreed.

This change adds a new question to coronavirus pathways for all users within appropriate age ranges and a new interstitial page directing those with pregnancy and fever to call 111.
