## Summary of release

This change amends the descriptions of A&E and UTC on the "Other ways to get help" page for patients that need mental-health support.

The description has been changed to:
"A&E can help in a mental health crisis or emergency. You should get someone to take you if you can, and bring a list of all your current medicines with you."
