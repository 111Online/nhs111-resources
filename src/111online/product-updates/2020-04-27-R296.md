## Summary of release

Emergency link to COVID testing gov.uk page.
The Secretary of State asked that Coronavirus testing is opened up to users through 111 online overnight. We added a link to the self-care page ([https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19/stayathome](https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19/stayathome)) to direct people to the existing testing portals on gov.uk/coronavirus.

Under the advice of NCSC, we were unable to deep link to the relevant point in the testing sign-up journey and as the journey is currently aimed at keyworkers, we needed to provide specific instructions as to how to navigate the journey from 111.

## Operational considerations

We will be amending the page throughout the day to fix identified bugs and improve the service.
