interviewing patients who had used the 111 Service in the last three
months:

### Intro

#### Future

-   If you had a need for urgent care again, what would you do?

## Appendix 4. Clinician Interview Discussion Guide

This is an example of the discussion guide that we used when interviewing clinicians. We adapted the discussion guide depending on the role of the clinician that we were speaking to.

### Intro 
Introduce the project and PEH information

### About the research participant:
-   Tell me about your role
-   Do you work across different services? Which services?
-   How do you go about diagnosing people in urgent care at the moment?

### Current Practice
-   When a patient presents themselves, currently, what information is available to you?
-   How do you use this information? Do you need to retrieve it or is automatically presented?
-   Where do you find the information? What systems do you use?
-   What are the biggest challenges when using this information?
-   What patient information is missing, that you think should be included?
-   What are the risks connected to this information in your current practice?
-   When you have no information what do you do then?
-   What do you currently do after a patient encounter?
-   What information is generated?
-   What is done with that information?

### Handover 
-   Tell me about handing over the patient to another service? (What happens to the patient\s information)
-   Do you do anything differently if you are at the end of that patient's journey (in emergency care)?

### Alerts
-   How are you alerted that a patient has been to emergency care recently? What if they presented themselves in another emergency setting (not in your practice)?
-   Would these alerts be helpful? Why?
-   Are you aware if the patient has triggered the RCS (repeat caller service (3 calls in 96hrs))?
-   How did RCS change your clinical practice?
-   If you see a patient 3-4 times in a short period of time, does that change how you treat or assess them?
-   What are the current limitations of RCS?
-   What thresholds (for time / number of contacts) would you set?

### PEH Information
-   Which patient encounter history information would you find most helpful to see?
-   What features of Patient Encounter History would you like to see, that would help your clinical decision-making?
-   What are the features that PEH would need to safeguard patients safety?
-   Which information is critical?
-   Which information would be "nice to have"?
-   Which information would be irrelevant or unnecessary?
-   How would you expect it to be presented so you can easily see pertinent information?
-   What would be the benefits of having patient encounter history?
-   How would you use that information?
-   What would be the risk connected with having a patient encounter history? What clinical risk might it cause?
-   Have you been in a setting where a more detailed patient encounter history has been available to you? How did that change your interaction with the patient?
-   How do you think your interaction with the patient may change if you had richer encounter history?
-   How would capturing patient encounters change your way of working?
-   Do you see any challenges with doing that?

### Timeframes
-   How far back should the patient encounter history go?
-   Why did you come to this conclusion? Can you give us an example of when this timeframe wouldn\'t work?
-   Do you see any risk with having or using PEH? What types?

### Risk stratification
-   What does risk stratification mean to you?
-   How do / would you use risk stratification in your clinical practice? How does it impact your clinical care?
-   How would the introduction of patient encounter history impact positively and negatively the following areas?
-   Individual, the risk of the patient coming to avoidable harm
-   Population, events presenting harm to the population as a whole (Covid-19, flu etc.)
-   Service, the information available in the service being unsafe
-   System overload, the risk of balancing demand versus safety
