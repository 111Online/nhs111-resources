## Summary of release

In order to address an emergent risk around breathlessness in our current coronavirus pathway - existing dispositions in the adult pathway have been updated.

This is a short-term addition to ensure that those who are cold or cool with shortness of breath at rest receive either an ambulance disposition (for worsening in the last hour) or the ‘speak to a clinician within one hour’ disposition.

This change effects the question flow of the coronavirus pathway and impacts any users of the service.
