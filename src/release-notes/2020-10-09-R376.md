## Summary of release

Update to the design and content for the Dx94 sexual assault outcome.

## Description

Dx94 is an ED disposition but is different to standard ED outcomes. When a user has declared a sexual assault they need to know what to do to preserve any evidence before presenting at a clinical setting. The order in which the information is conveyed is therefore much more important in this context.

Desk research has revealed that standard ED settings aren't always the most appropriate for dealing with this issue as they may lack specialist staff and time to deal with the emotional fallout as well as the physical symptoms.

Where sexual assault referral centres (SARCs) are profiled in DoS these will return as the recommended service. Where they are not profiled in DoS and a user is presented with A&E as the recommended service, we have now included a direct link to the NHS.UK service finder to enable users to search for other, more specialist support in their area, or close by, if they choose to.

We also include links to appropriate, independent charities, as detailed on NHS.UK who could offer further support guidance or help.
Organisations involved with supporting people who have been sexually assaulted have been involved in the content development and confirm it is appropriate.

## Impacts

Stakeholders to be aware that additional services may be shown.
