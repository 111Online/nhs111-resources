## Summary of release

Case definition changes to add loss of smell and taste to symptoms.

Following guidance from the Chief Medical Officer loss of smell (anosmia) and loss of taste (ageusia) have been added to the case definition for Covid-19. If these symptoms are present self-isolation and testing should take place.

## Operational considerations

NHS services using 111 online for coronavirus may need to be aware of the changes to the recognised symptoms and the new/updated pages.
