## Summary

Children between the age of 5 and 15 years who present to 111 online, worried about coronavirus and have specific symptoms in line with Public Health England case definitions (fever and new continuous cough) will be triaged through the 111 online coronavirus pathway for children.

## Operational considerations

Any provider using 111 online within their general operations should consider the new paediactric flow which will operate for those with a DOB that equals age 16 and under.

## Other general impacts

Any clinical callback queue that is receiving ITK clinical call backs from 111 online coronavirus assessment service may receive patients that have been assessed through this pathway
