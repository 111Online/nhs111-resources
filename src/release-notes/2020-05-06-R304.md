## Summary of release

New start screen for the 111 online coronavirus mini-service.

The new start screen divides users into clearer streams â€“ those with symptoms, those who want information and those who need an isolation note. Recent feedback suggested significant sections of the public continue to view 111 online as a starting point for coronavirus concerns. However, we are now receiving traffic from people who either have no coronavirus symptoms or have recovered from the illness. As a result, we have restructured the page to emphasise other helpful avenues for visitors not experiencing symptoms such as links to nhs.uk for information and to the isolation note service.

## Operational considerations

NHS services using 111 online for coronavirus may need to be aware of the change to the start page.
