# Provider out-of-service: planned and unplanned downtime

When an urgent care provider goes out of service, whether expected or not, in addition to informing NHSE of your NHS 111 downtime (using the currently agreed change advisory board procedures), local teams can act themselves to stop receiving referrals from NHS 111 online during the outage.

These instructions explain how providers can stop receiving cases from [NHS 111 online](111.nhs.uk) during a service outage. This can be managed locally by editing profiles in the Directory of Services (DoS).

## Planned Downtime

### Providers:

1. Contact your area DoS Team to let them know of the service outage & cc nhs111online@nhs.net

### DoS Teams:

1. On receipt of a notification from the Provider, identify which NHS 111 online DoS profiles have endpoints that will be affected by the downtime

2. Use Specified Opening Time to override the normal Mon-Sun opening times for specific dates as required. Please note profiles will need the open all hours setting off (replace with 00:00-23:59 opening seven days a week) and the only return if open setting on.

3. Once the downtime has completed, profile opening timings will revert to normal

**Important note**, for profiles that control both online and telephony referrals, rather than adjusting the opening times as above, the digital referral role will need removing so the profile continues to return for the telephony contingency provider.

## Unplanned Downtime

### Providers:

1. Contact your area DoS Team to let them know of the service outage & cc nhs111online@nhs.net

### DoS Teams:

- Identify which DoS profiles have endpoints that are affected by the outage

- Decide whether to specify an opening time or manually recover the service. This will depend on factors such as your confidence in a fix time, or availability of staff to restore the service.

**If you are using a specified opening time:**
1. Use Specified Opening Time to override the normal Mon-Sun opening times for a date period longer than downtime is expected to last. Please note profiles will need the open all hours setting off (replace with 00:00-23:59 opening seven days a week) and the only return if open setting on.

2. Once the time period has passed, profile opening timings will revert to normal 

If downtime finished earlier than the specified opening timw, there may be a period where NHS 111 online referrals are not received after the downtime has finished.

**If you are manually recovering the service:**
1. Remove digital referral role from the profiles

2. Once the downtime has completed, add digital referral role back on to relevant profiles



Commissioners are encouraged to find cost-effective ways to enable urgent DoS changes during the out-of-hours period. They might choose to do one or more of the following:

- establish an on-call facility among DoS personnel
- utilise existing on-call structures (e.g. directors) or 24/7 staff groups (e.g. IUC/999 supervisor desks)
- enable direct access by key individual providers
