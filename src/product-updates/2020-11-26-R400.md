## Summary of release

### v23.2.1 Pathways Update

Description: The interim release addresses three principal issues:

- Improved wordings to some symptom questions to help people with darker skin answer accurately
- Support for coronavirus patients receiving remote monitoring of blood oxygen levels (presently suppressed online)
- Updated coronavirus checks for young children (currently not switched on)
  The interim release also improves a few other questions not related to the objectives above.
